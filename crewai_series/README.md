# Starter CrewAI series

This set of packages use a common requirements.txt. Each day represents a different example. These are based on the [Tyler AI: Watch These to Learn CrewAI YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwPL8GA9A_un2_WrDekhx0SFLO4TVYZd1) and related code from [Github tylerprogramming/ai](https://github.com/tylerprogramming/ai/tree/main/crewai_series). If you want a suitable tutorial then look at the aforementioned YouTube series. If looking at the code in this repos series then be sure to see the README for each example it will likely explain any differentials from the YouTube video/tylerprogramming video. An example is that Day_03 I did not create because the serper.dev registration was broken and for that same reason in day_04 I used the Tavily search API instead.
